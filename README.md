# SITS Single Page Applications
This project aims to enhance the current SITS Tasking offering to create simple single page applications.
I chose the react framework as unlike other client side frameworks such as Angular, it only concerns itself with rendering the application state.
The motivations for this project were to create a highly re-usable component based framework to enable the rapidly application of SITS solutions whilst providing consistency, testability and a modern user experience.

## What do i need?
- A SITS environment (preferably not production)
- An e:Vision environment
- A license for SITS tasking (SV202)
- A solid grasp of SITS tasking and SRL development

## What would be beneficial?
- Knowledge of latest javascript techniques (es6/node)
- Knowledge of the React/Redux frameworks
- Perseverance

## How Does it work?

This solution utilises the React and Redux libraries to render a single page client side application to the end user. The client interacts with the SITS application via multiple hidden inputs and buttons which have been created utilising standard SITS components (TTE, TTQ, TEC, TCR).
